# For this project, I downloaded The SQL Murder Mystery from King lab into SQLiteStudio.
# Then, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.


#Background Information:A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. 
You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. 

#1 Retrieve the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.
SELECT * FROM crime_scene_report 
WHERE type = 'murder' 
AND city = 'SQL City'
AND date = '20180115';

#2 Based on the information on the crime scene report,  Who are the two witness?
SELECT * FROM person 
WHERE address_street_name = 'Northwestern Dr' 
ORDER BY address_number DESC LIMIT 1;

SELECT * FROM person 
WHERE name like '%Annabel%'
AND address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave';

#3 Write a query that shows the interview transcripts for our two subjects.
SELECT p.name,i.transcript
FROM person p
JOIN interview i
ON i.person_id = p.id
WHERE p.name = 'Morty Schapiro'
OR p.name = 'Annabel Miller';

#4 Write a query that shows all members whos membership id starts with a "48Z"and are gold members.
SELECT *
FROM get_fit_now_member 
WHERE id LIKE '%48Z%'
AND membership_status = 'gold'

#5 Who is the murderer?
SELECT p.name, d.gender, d.plate_number, m.id, c.check_in_date
FROM drivers_license d

JOIN person AS p 
ON p.license_id = d.id

JOIN get_fit_now_member m 
ON m.person_id = p.id

JOIN get_fit_now_check_in c 
ON c.membership_id = m.id

WHERE d.plate_number LIKE '%H42W%'
AND c.check_in_date = '20180109'
AND m.id LIKE '%48Z%'
AND m.membership_status = 'gold';
